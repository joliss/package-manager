Instead of separate file include/exclude arrays, do we want a negation syntax?
There's some precedents for this in .gitignore syntax and Node's globbing
library.

files: [
    "**/*.rs"
    "!vendor/**"
    "vendor/foo.rs"
]

Meaning, include all the .rs files except the ones in vendor. But do include
vendor/foo.rs.

This is something that cannot be done with include/exclude arrays because they
force us to apply all include rules first.





Two use cases:

1. I want to publish all files tracked by git plus some gitignored files. Then I
   want my include pattern to match everything.

2. I want to publish only files I select. Then perhaps I want my include pattern
   to only match files tracked by git.



"src"   // only tracked
"?src"  // everything
"!src"  // exclude src


files [
  scm
  "src/generated.rs"
]

scm {
  provider "git"
  include_tracked_files true
}



scm {
  files false
}

files [
  ...
]



files [
  scm
]



scm {
  provider "auto"
  files false
}

files [
  "src/**/*.rs"
  "!vendor"
]
